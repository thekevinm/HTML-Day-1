		<h2>About Me!</h2>
		<p>I am 19 and new to code! I have had a passion for computers and jumped at the oppurtunity to be apart of the first class at PunchCode<a href="https://punchcode.org/apply">(Click here to apply)</a>. I was born and raised in Las Vegas and this city has grown apart of me. I love all the places you can go and see just by travelling to the strip.</p>
			<h3>My Hobbies</h3>
			<p>I enjoy playing basketball in my free time and love playing video games. One of my favorite games at the moment is <a href="https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/">Overwatch</a> and my favorite basketball team is the <span>Lakers</span>!</p><img src="http://i.cdn.turner.com/nba/nba/.element/img/1.0/teamsites/logos/teamlogos_500x500/lal.png">
				<h4>My Intro To Computers</h4>
				<p>I had been into computers since a young age but was never able to afford my own. Being a freshman in high school with too much time on my hands I learned how to build my own PC for much cheaper than buying a pre-built system.</p>
